                                <h2>Huizhong Ye 叶慧中</h2>
                                <p>
                                    I am an innovative designer and researcher who aims to bridge users and technology with fluent and fascinating user experience design. 
                                    My expertise spans the domain of Human-Computer-Interaction, Wearables, User-Centered Design, Data-Enabled Design, etc. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Throughout my endeavors, I continuously seek answers to these questions:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>How can technology be a facilitator to human connections with each other and with the world around us? </li>
                                        <li>How can technology be designed to integrate into life for supporting instead of distracting workflow?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>M.Sc Industrial Design</span> Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)</p>
                                <p><span>B.E Industrial Design</span> Zhejiang University (ZJU)</p>
                                
                                <h3>Vision</h3>
                                <h4>Connected everything</h4>
                                <p>In the future, intelligence will be integrated into the everyday objects we take for granted, such as clothing. "Ordinary objects can have extraordinary capabilities after smartness enabled." 
                                    Daily objects will provide humans with more information, feedback, and intervention based on the context in which they are located. 
                                    Therefore, humans, and their environments, will be more closely connected than ever before,  breaking through the limitations of time and space.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Natural HCI</h4>
                                <p>With the ubiquitous computing development, human-computer interaction could happen anytime, anywhere, to support fluent and natural workflow. 
                                    Thus, people will not pay too much attention to the virtual world but can enjoy people, the environment, and objects in real life more. 
                                    I believe future interactions will be more natural, which means the interactions would involve more body, environmental, and social awareness.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Designer as a bridge</h4>
                                <p>The role of a designer, from my point of view, is a bridge between emerging technology and users. 
                                    From the user's perspective, they gain insight into human behavior and psychology, find the most suitable technology and propose innovative solutions. 
                                    From the perspective of technology, they can expand the application advantages, let the technology be integrated in a way that adapts to rather than disturbing life, in order to realize its value.
                                </p>


                                <h3>Professional Identity</h3>
                                <h4>Multidisciplinary designer</h4>
                                <p>I am a curious person, so I have collected a wide set of skills. They enable my communication with collaborators and stakeholders from different disciplines (i.e. psychology, engineering, business, etc.) and drive me to quickly learn new knowledge from various fields. 
                                    My professional skills in visuals (i.e. sketch, 3D modeling and rendering, and video editing) help me to convey my opinions and concepts in an understandable way. The technical skills (i.e. electronic, coding, and engineering) help me to quickly prototype and validate my design. 
                                    I want to be a multidisciplinary generalist, with this goal I keep exploring and position myself as a life-long learner.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Human observer</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I like to observe humans, their behaviors, expression, and thinking. All the clues provide inspiration and insights about design. 
                                    So I normally start with user research and follow a user-centered design process, where users are always a part of the design. I also evaluate my concept with users, conducting the research-through-design process in field, where I can capture real thoughts through observing. 
                                    Data is a special angle to observe. And it's interesting to subjectively get insights from the objective data with users through the data-enabled design process.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Interest in wearables</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The previous experience of wearable projects has cultivated my interest in future wearable design. I see wearables as the interface between people and their body, other people, and the environment, so it has great potential for development. 
                                    But at the same time, it also has different requirements from other products, such as wearability, ergonomics, and sustainability. 
                                    In the future, I hope to continue to study this interesting topic and strive to create value by integrating user needs, business needs, and technical possibilities.
                                </p>
