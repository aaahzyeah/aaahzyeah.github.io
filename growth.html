                                <p>
                                    I am currently a graduating student in Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands. 
                                    I develop my overall competence by self-directly following an adapted competency model [1], which combines a vision, professional identity and the individual competencies. 
                                    On this page, I reflect on my development on attitudes, professional skills, and different expertise areas.                                </p>

                                            <h4>Design and Research Process</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                With my bachelor's background in industrial design at ZJU, I have developed a good command of the user-centered design process and user research skillset. 
                                                During my master's program at TU/e, I broadened my view to more design and research methodologies and learned that design and research are so tightly related.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In the core course "Constructive Design Research", I learned that we not only could use research to guide and value design, but also develop the approach towards Research through Design. 
                                                The three approaches to conducting the research, namely the lab, field, and showroom, equipped me with an overall knowledge of how to plan and apply these approaches to guide the research process. 
                                                After practice in "Project 2 Design Research", as well as the research internship in CDI, I learned how to frame the research question in design scope, and how to flexibly position research and design in my project based on my need.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Other design methodology, such as "Data-Enabled Design", and "Transformative Practices” that I learned from electives, enriched my library. 
                                                Currently, I can choose to adopt those methodologies in projects based on the context and business need.

                                            <h4>User & Society</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                As a designer, I always believe that design starts with users' needs. And it's the designer's responsibility to understand users and satisfy or convey their needs through innovative solutions. I kept my user-centered design process in my "Project 1 Design", where I overcome the cultural and age gap, conducted user interviews with several Dutch elderly users. 
                                                In order to design for behavior change, I learned that designers should open their minds to users, observe and listen more with great empathy. It's also useful to switch design activities among the first, second, and third-person perspectives, which is also what I learned in “User Experience Theory and Practice”. 
                                                Throughout these experiences, I am able to analyze user problems through related theories and to develop the design strategy based on the analysis results.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Besides users, stakeholders are significant to form the design context and make the concept work, especially in the business design scope. I enrolled stakeholders in the "Project 1 Design", "Design for Social Innovation" and "Creating Corporate Entrepreneurship", where external feedback was gathered for improving the concept to be more practical. 
                                                Finally, I am able to organize workshops with designers, users, and stakeholders to co-creation, where the concept or prototype of design could promote discussion and useful feedback will be collected for iterations.

                                            <h4>Technology & Realization</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                The 3D modeling, 3D printing, and laser cutting skills that I mastered at the undergraduate stage allowed me to realize my concept in quick prototypes. I am also familiar with Arduino programming and development, which allows me to enrich my concept with more interactive possibilities. 
                                                During my masters' study, I developed my competence in this area by applying these techniques to all the tangible designs, especially "The Magpie's Bridge", an art installation for GLOW2020. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Moreover, I keep myself curious about emerging technologies and regard them as special design materials. In "Project 1 Design" and "Project 2 Research Desing", I learned how to embed sensors into everyday soft things, and tried out some smart textile techniques. 
                                                In the course "Embodying intelligent behavior", I learned different types of algorithms and how to apply the existing AI models to a python program. In the "Data-Enabled Design" and "Project at ID", I was able to build small IoT systems with ESP32 and different platforms. In the "Des user interfaces with emerging tech", various HCI technology, inspired me to apply them to use cases.

                                            <h4>Creativity & Aesthetics</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                I think the overlapped area between art and design is about expression. Only when the design is visualized and physicalized in a creative and aesthetic way can the concept reach the user more successfully. Though this competence mostly relies on the balance between intuition and knowledge-driven design, I learned creativity can be inspired by various methods, such as co-creation sessions. 
                                                Technology is an emerging design material that could bring more creativity and aesthetics to a concept. In the challenge of Embodying intelligent behavior, the interaction between anthropomorphic graphics and breathing was inspired by technology. In addition, looking back on my experience of "The Magpie Bridge", I combined classical and modern art to design an installation with oriental culture for the Western Light Festival. 
                                                Such cross-cultural and cross-age attempts made me realize the significance of aesthetics for an inclusive society and human sense of belonging. It also showed that "combination" is a method of creativity and aesthetics.

                                                Nowadays, products have become more data-intensive, which allows continuous access to real-time data through the Internet of Things (IoT). I learned how to frame a context scope and collect data through various sensors related to activities and context information. Data provides me with in-depth insights about user behavior and mental status, which support me in analysis and ideation.

                                                In my "Project 2 research design", I got command on the mathematical knowledge about scientific data analysis, such as one-way ANOVA, and Friedman test, and practiced them with the SPSS tool. I believe that the skills of statistical analysis must be useful in my future career.

                                                Meanwhile, during the course "Embodying intelligent behavior", I’ve learned the basics of machine learning, which allows me to add intelligence to the products and services. I gained first-hand experience in implementing algorithms into a python program that could recognize the emotion of students and provide explainable statistic feedback to teachers in the online lectures.
